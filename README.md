# Competitive Man
Example of using the [Competitive Controller](https://github.com/aleksandrpp/CompetitiveController) with a strafe movement animator. It includes the Unity Animation Rigging and Input System packages. There are also a pair of prefabs with an IK rig called Runner and Gunner, which are used for testing interactive and shooting scenes.
